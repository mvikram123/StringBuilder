# StringBuilder
The StringBuilder object sb is created and initialized with the string "hello".
The deleteCharAt(0) method is called on sb to delete the character at index 0, which is 'h'.
The insert(0, "H") method is then called on sb to insert the character 'H' at index 0.
Finally, the append(" World!") method is used to append the string " World!" to the modified StringBuilder object.
The resulting StringBuilder object is printed using System.out.println().
